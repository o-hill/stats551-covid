This project is the final project for STATS 551: Topics in Bayesian modeling and computation at the University of Michigan Winter 2021 semester. 

The main script for performing this analysis is in `analysis.py`. Looking at the arguments in the argparse part of the main function, one can customize the model to save results tailored to what the user wants.

The final report for this project is available [here](https://github.com/o-hill/stats551-covid/files/6347029/stats551_hill_kouz_final_report.pdf).
